# Eywa
Eywa (formerly UNIoTE) is a fog computing infrastructure that provides control and data planes for RDF stream processing to be performed on resource-constrained client, source and broker nodes.

Continuous queries are registered by clients in RSP-QL, an extension of the SPARQL query language.

The [wiki](https://github.com/eugenesiow/UNIOTE-Node/wiki) contains more information of how UNIOTE works.
